     <b> Swami Vivekananda</b> (/ˈswɑːmi ˌvɪveɪˈkɑːnəndə/; Bengali: [ʃami bibekanɔndo] ⓘ; IAST: Swāmī Vivekānanda ; 12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902), born <b>Narendranath Datta</b> (Bengali: [nɔrendronatʰ dɔto]), was an <span class="blue-text">Indian Hindu</span> monk, philosopher, author, religious teacher, and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic <span class="blue-text">Ramakrishna</span>.[4][5] He was a key figure in the introduction of<span class="blue-text">Vedanta</span>  and <span class="blue-text">Yoga</span>Yoga to the Western world,[6][7][8] and the father of modern Indian nationalism who is credited with raising <span class="blue-text">interfaith</span> awareness and bringing <span class="blue-text">Hinduism</span> to the status of a major world religion.[9
  </p>
  <p>Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family in Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined from a young age towards religion and spirituality. He later found his guru Ramakrishna and became a monk. After the death of  , Vivekananda extensively toured the Indian subcontinent acquiring first-hand knowledge of the living conditions of Indian people in then British India. Moved by their plight, he resolved to help his countrymen and found a way to travel to the United States, where he became a popular figure after the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago at which he delivered his famous speech beginning with the words: "Sisters and brothers of America ..." while introducing Hinduism to Americans.[10][11] He was so impactful at the Parliament that an American newspaper described him as "an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the Parliament".</p>

  <p>After great success at the Parliament, in the subsequent years, Vivekananda delivered hundreds of lectures across the United States, England and Europe, disseminating the core tenets of Hindu philosophy, and founded the Vedanta Society of New York and the Vedanta Society of San Francisco (now Vedanta Society of Northern California),[13] both of which became the foundations for Vedanta Societies in the West. In India, Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math, which provides spiritual training for monastics and householder devotees, and the Ramakrishna Mission, which provides charity, social work and education.</p>
